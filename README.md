# Photo Memories
An Android app to prompt you to take pictures every day

---

Every day, things happen in our lives thaat we could keep track of and form memories of, if only we could remember to document them. This goal of this app is to prompt the user to take a picture relating to a specific prompt each day, then tag the image in google photos with the prompt.

For example, 'Take a picture of your kids eating dinner', or 'Take a picture of your back yard today'
